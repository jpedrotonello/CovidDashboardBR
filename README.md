# Covid Dashboard Brazil
Business Intelligence Dashboard to analyze the Coronavirus data in Brazil

I created this dashboard in order to analyze the Covid-19 with an interactive dashboard. I did because there's no interactive panel on the internet with all the complexity I want to analyze to know if it's safe, increasing the number of cases or getting better. You can also download the data in .csv and the pbix file if you want to explore what I did.

I recorded the video below to show you how my dashboard works and I hope you enjoy it :)
