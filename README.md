# Covid Dashboard Brazil
Business Intelligence Dashboard to analyze the Coronavirus data in Brazil

I created this dashboard in order to analyze the Covid-19 with an interactive dashboard. I did because there's no interactive panel on the internet with all the complexity I want to analyze to know if it's safe, increasing the number of cases or getting better. You can also download the pbix file if you want to explore what I did. It's not possible to upload the dataset on my repository due to the file size, but the csv file of the daily updated database I use on my report can be downloaded here: https://covid.saude.gov.br/

I recorded the video below to show you how my dashboard works. Click on it to see on youtube. I hope you enjoy it :)
